# hello-world
first repository ever ski
This is the first README.md I have ever editted. I am trying to get use to using something like git
for tracking file edits and projects. I have never used anything for version control before.

I am really starting to like HTML and PHP.

LINUX FOR LIFE!!!!!


ok for real, this has to be the last time I edit this document.
